                      “I grew up in Primrose Park, near Manenberg, with my mom
                      and dad and two siblings, an older and a younger brother.
                      My mom and dad split up a few years back, I think I was in
                      GR10 which impacted us as we had to move around a lot. It
                      was a rough time when my dad left, leaving me to step up
                      to help my mom around the house and making sure my brother
                      was doing homework. My mom was doing two jobs at the time
                      in order to make extra money for us.

                      I matriculated from Oude Molen in 2010 and pursued a
                      graphic design career which didn’t work out due to
                      financial constraints. So, I started working at an
                      investment company as an administrator. It was quite a
                      cool job, I enjoyed learning about how the financial
                      markets worked. Unfortunately, I only held a temp position
                      for a lady on maternity leave, so on her return, I was
                      out.

                      I was not sure what I wanted to do with my life but the
                      idea to do a TEFL qualification and travel was attractive.
                      Fortunately, my Mom gave this to me for my 21st, so after
                      some time, I went to teach in China. That was four years
                      ago – it was a fresh and valuable time to learn about
                      different cultures and myself. I was there for eight
                      months but I couldn’t get my visa renewed so so I had to
                      return home. During this time my best friend sent me a
                      link for the Life Choices Coding Academy. But my heart was
                      set on going back to China, so I didn’t follow the coding
                      opportunity immediately until my friend basically forced
                      me to apply.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      My application was successful and I was invited to a one
                      day information boot camp which involved a whole lot of
                      aptitude tests. Getting through these tests led to a 2
                      week life skills boot camp – this was another milestone to
                      overcome before being admitted to the 6 month coding
                      course.

                      The 2 weeks bonded the group and set us up with core life
                      skills:

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      Financial budgeting was an eye opener for me – it is the
                      skill I use every day of my life. Before this course I
                      never budgeted. I used to spend recklessly without a
                      thought for the future.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      Something that really stood out for me during the 2 weeks
                      was turning walls into doors. We learnt to look at the
                      full picture of any situation, analyse our options,
                      consider the impacts of our choices and we were taught how
                      to use informed awareness to make healthy decisions. We
                      learnt to break down the obstacle (the wall) and walk
                      through the door.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      Another gift I took from the life skills was learning to
                      rely on others, no matter what you are going through,
                      trusting that you can turn to someone. The way we learnt
                      this was through the Thinking Pair skill. We would be
                      divided into pairs where we were taught how to listen
                      mindfully and how to be comfortable talking and being
                      listened to.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      It was a masterful 2 weeks culminating in a 1-1
                      conversation with the head of the academy where I was told
                      I had been accepted on the 6 month course. Having not
                      known what coding was, I immersed myself in the various
                      languages we were learning – I used to get home and all I
                      wanted to do was code. It felt like my future was
                      unfolding and I was excited about what was available to
                      me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      During the 6 months we attended professional and personal
                      development courses which offered a holistic way of
                      growing and healing. It was also compulsory to see a
                      counsellor during the 6 months. There were things I didn’t
                      know I was holding onto which I wasn’t aware of - the
                      counselling helped me confront these things and to become
                      accepting and whole.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      I really enjoyed the professional development which has
                      helped me to be more effective in the workplace. It gave
                      me the skills to know how to work powerfully with
                      different types of people in the workplace. Understanding
                      emotional intelligence is a skill which has benefitted me
                      both at work and in life. Simply, EQ is effective whether
                      you are at shops or facing road rage – being able to step
                      back and trying to understand what someone else is going
                      through helps me not to react. I’ve learnt to think before
                      I act, before I speak. Added to the EQ skills where I did
                      a Mindfulness course every 2nd Wednesday. It helped me to
                      know my emotions, feel them and let them pass through
                      without holding onto them and taking them out on others.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      Immediately after my graduation from the Coding Academy I
                      started my first internship at a company which creates
                      apps and websites. I was taken on as a junior website
                      developer. We built websites from scratch using a mock-up
                      which we had turned into a live website or app.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      The workload was pretty intense which caused anxiety at
                      times. Using the skills I had learnt at the Coding Academy
                      helped me to function more mindfully and to manage the
                      anxiety. A coding classmate had joined the company with
                      me, so he and I used the Thinking Pairs skills and Walls
                      into doors skills to support one another. I don’t think I
                      would have been able to handle the internship the way I
                      did, without my classmate there and without the skills
                      we’d learnt. Towards the end of my internship my manager
                      gave an assessment which resulted in me getting a position
                      straight after my internship. Currently I am managing 4
                      coding interns from Life Choices so I am growing my
                      management and leadership skills, which are underpinned by
                      the life and professional skills I got at the academy. I
                      am loving watching the interns grow and seeing them
                      embrace their skills and responsibilities in order to
                      develop themselves. I feel excited to have been identified
                      as the senior front end developer with the company
                      exposing me to management development.

                      Looking ahead I see my future as focused on my skills

                      goal is to retire at 40. I don’t plan to retire in the
                      sense of not working, but see myself opening my own
                      company where I can help people, young and old, to get the
                      kind of technical and life skills which I have been so
                      fortunate to gain.

                      “I grew up in Philippi with a single mom – there were 5
                      children. The first 3 children, of which I was the 2nd
                      born, were born to a father we never knew. My mom had 2
                      more children with my stepdad, who was always ‘Dad’ to me.
                      When I was in Gr3, my older brother, who was a genius and
                      a model child who never got into trouble the way I did
                      growing up, passed due to Asthma. So I became the eldest
                      child with 4 sisters which I guess is what positioned me
                      to become responsible in a way. My youngest sister was
                      sent to live with my stepdad’s parents in Lesotho, so I’ve
                      grown up not really knowing her – I heard recently that
                      she had matriculated last year. I feel really sad that I
                      haven’t known her growing up and I worry because her
                      grandparents are very old.

                      plan for the 4 of us in spite of being a domestic worker.

                      maintained our relationship even though my Mom and my
                      stepdad separated 5 years ago. I will always be grateful

                      academically, especially enjoying technology and science.
                      I attended a really good science and technology school in
                      Khayelitsha, matriculating in 2013. During the SA Science
                      Expo in 2012, we won gold medals for our orange peel
                      recycling polystyrene experiment. This resulted in us
                      being invite to go to China for 2 weeks to present the
                      project at the Beijing Youth Science Competition. That
                      experience exposed me to a new culture and a wider world
                      view making me realise that the world is bigger than it
                      had seemed growing up.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      It was during this time that I developed an interest in
                      computers - I knew that I wanted to do Computer Science so
                      after matric I enrolled as a Computer Science major at
                      UCT. My interest was in computers and gaming. I was at UCT
                      for 3 years but didn’t do very well in my 3rd year,
                      causing me to lose my sponsor. Without the sponsor, I was
                      unable to go back to university. Reflecting back I started
                      losing focus in my 2nd year and disconnecting from my
                      friends. I lost perspective of my “why”. Perhaps I didn’t
                      even know my “why” in the first place.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      Being out of uni, I spent a lot of time on the internet.
                      Whilst browsing, I discovered the Life Choices Coding
                      Academy on Face Book. I saw a link inviting me to register
                      for the next Coding Cohort. Once Life Choices responded to
                      my application, a whole new avenue opened up for me. If I
                      hadn’t come across the Life Choices Coding Academy after
                      UCT, I would probably still be watching series and eating
                      junk food. I knew there was a lot more to my life with
                      many possibilities, but I just couldn’t see a way to tap
                      into possibility. There were no jobs without a skill set
                      or qualification. I was disillusioned.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      Part of the Coding course requirement was that we had to
                      attend Professional Development Sessions which included
                      self-awareness and mindfulness classes. We got to look at
                      our habits, our way of thinking, our attitudes as well as
                      the things that got us excited in life. This helped me to
                      reconnect to my “why” and I started to see clearly where
                      my path could lead.

                      Because I wasn’t earning money whilst doing the Coding
                      Course, I was reliant on my Mom which was stressing me
                      out. I didn’t have a laptop at home so I was dependant on
                      the Academy resources. It meant starting my day early to
                      get to a computer at the Academy to ensure my coding work
                      was done to the level I had set for myself. Because of my
                      stress I was getting bad headaches. Fortunately during the
                      6 month coding course, we get to have 1-1 coaching
                      sessions. The coaches were a critical part to me accepting
                      what I had control over and what I had no control over. It
                      helped me to focus on the things I could work on, and let
                      go of the things I couldn’t influence. Once I started
                      isolating what I could control, my stress levels became
                      more manageable and my relationship with tutors and peers
                      started improving. Looking back I think I would have
                      probably dropped out of the Coding Academy like I did at
                      UCT, had I not been exposed to self-development and
                      coaching support, which offered a holistic approach. Those
                      life skills empowered me and I still use meditation,
                      breathe work and mindfulness to check in with myself.

                      One of the Professional Development courses we went
                      through was focused on how to interact with others and how
                      to show up professionally. Emotional Intelligence was a
                      critical learning for us and has continued to help me
                      introspect. We were also taken through interviewing
                      skills, having to role play an interview on camera. It was
                      a very valuable experience to be able to see myself in an
                      “interview” and to have knowledge about how I can make or
                      break an interview and it has given me a confidence.

                      Eventually I got a job as a waitress at the Spur. I had
                      been working there for about 18 months when one day my old
                      GR6 teacher came into the Spur. She gave me a Life Choices
                      Coding Academy pamphlet. When I got home I did some
                      research about whether this was something I might want to
                      do. Because coding is a 21st century skill which doesn’t
                      limit your work outputs and which encourages innovation I
                      decided that this was a valuable opportunity so I applied
                      for the Coding Course at Life Choices and did the online
                      test at an internet café before going to my waitressing
                      job. The test was a bit hectic and I was nervous but I
                      tried my best.

                      I saw the coding course as a way out of my situation and a
                      way for me to start building a career path. I felt excited
                      and I really wanted to do this, so when Candice called me
                      after I’d done the test, to ask me for my email address, I
                      started feeling hopeful. When I got the email advising
                      that I had been accepted to do the Coding Academy 2 week
                      Life Skills course, I was super relieved and excited and
                      so emotional. But I remember also feeling anxious because
                      I had set my hopes on this opportunity, and on the first
                      day we were told that doing the 2 week course didn’t
                      automatically qualify us to be accepted onto the course.

                      During the 2 week I got to view ‘my’ life differently.
                      When we worked with ‘tackling our inner giants’ I got to
                      see the things that held me back in my life. I got to
                      realise that my internal thoughts caused self-doubt which
                      often had me give up and brought me down. Through the life
                      skills course I realised that I am capable of more and
                      I’ve learnt to look at what I’ve achieved rather than what
                      I haven’t achieved. Now, when I am facing a negative
                      thought I remember how far I’ve come and I reset my
                      thinking. At the end of the 2 weeks an announcement was
                      made advising who was going to enter the coding course – I
                      had made it! Once again I felt relieved and excited.

                      Aspects that stood out for me were learning about
                      presentation skills and how to show up at an interview –
                      we had to practise mock interviews in front of a camera
                      which gave valuable insight and opportunity to show up
                      differently. We had training on grooming for an interview
                      - how to dress and how to be confident enough to ask
                      questions of the interviewer. We were assessed on how we
                      used the skills and were given additional support to
                      improve ourselves.

                      how people respond differently to me. I learnt to accept
                      others as they are, trying to see their lives from their
                      perspective. This has been invaluable in the workplace
                      because working in a diverse team, I am able to accept and

                      professional interview. I learned that it is ok to ask
                      questions about the company and the internship and I
                      realised that an interview is a two-way conversation.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      I felt my internship interview went well and I was
                      ‘over-the-moon’ when I heard that I had been accepted as
                      an intern. Twelve of us were accepted from the Coding
                      Academy. We got put into different teams - this was the
                      start of my career! This was my chance to learn and grow
                      and shine.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      I was integrated into the company and showed the systems
                      which made it an easy adjustment into my first job even
                      though my days were long. I had to get up at 04h00 to get
                      to work on time and only got home at 19h00. Everything was
                      new and the work load initially was overwhelming but
                      having my teammates support made it easier and using
                      mindfulness helped me keep perspective. Another skill I
                      have used is time management, which definitely helped to
                      get me through the early days of the internship.
                      Practising the Thinking Pairs technique, which we’d learnt
                      during the coding course was my way of adjusting to
                      working and the challenges I was facing. Having learnt
                      that I have a right to be heard, has enabled me to reach
                      out when I am struggling with someone. And having someone
                      hold a place of listening to me helps me to process my
                      thoughts and to often find solutions.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      At the end of my 6 month internship, we were told that
                      they wouldn’t be placing any of the interns in full time
                      positions. In the meantime my boss had written a
                      motivation to keep me at the company. I wasn’t aware of
                      this at the time, so I started looking for other work.
                      Fortunately there was a junior position opening in the
                      company which my boss encouraged me to apply for. I was
                      successful and was appointed as a junior CRM developer.
                      That was a highlight moment for me and added to the
                      confidence I was developing.

                      as I can whilst I am being trained into Customer Relations
                      Management Development. Looking ahead, I plan to become
                      more skilled in technology as I focus on becoming a senior
                      developer. I feel like I have found a career which a
                      couple of years ago I knew nothing about. Being a 21st

                      “Most of my life was spent growing up in Lotus River. It’s
                      a troubled community with lots of challenges, most
                      specifically crime and drugs which are big problems there.
                      Like many poor neighbourhoods, we had a lot to deal with.
                      Loads of kids don’t finish school so unemployment is high
                      which results in a big gangster culture and intensifies
                      the crime levels. This creates a dark underlying
                      community. I feel fortunate that the area I grew up in was
                      tight-knit with people looking out for each other,
                      neighbourhood support and generally children felt
                      protected. However the ‘dark side’ inspired me to aim high
                      in my life.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      Fortunately when I was ready to go to high school, my Mom
                      had a good job and was able to send me to a school in a
                      more affluent area. I felt more privileged than my friends
                      from Lotus River. It motivated me to work hard and to use
                      the opportunity to its fullest to ensure I made something
                      of myself. My first high school in the “leafy suburbs” was
                      largely attended by coloured learners, so it wasn’t a
                      problem adjusting to this affluent school.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      But when I moved to Camps Bay High ??? I became aware of
                      the cultural diversity and the socio-economic divide in
                      South Africa. At the beginning I was treated differently
                      because of my race. I wasn’t used to racism, having grown
                      up in post-Apartheid South Africa and in predominantly
                      coloured schools where I was the ‘norm’. At first it was
                      tough but then I found the humour in that the ‘others’
                      were curious about me, and we started to bond. I felt
                      proud to attend this school. I wanted to show that I was
                      grateful for this opportunity which motivated me to work
                      hard and excel in matric.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      In my last 2 years of high school I realised I had a real
                      aptitude for math and science and I wanted to dive deeper
                      into the science of mathematics. This drew me to apply to
                      study Actuarial Science at UCT. I started 1st year on this
                      course but pretty soon I felt I hadn’t made the right
                      choice – I found it a bleak field of study. Once I’d
                      completed 1st year I made a choice to give up my studies.
                      With this realisation, I felt compromised because my
                      studies had cost my parents a lot of money. I felt as
                      though everything I had worked for had been in vain and
                      that I had thrown away an opportunity. The initial impact
                      of this was that I was left feeling depressed, wondering
                      if I was just going to be another unemployed statistic in
                      the Cape Flats, possibly raising a child without a
                      qualification and without hope. I didn’t want to add to
                      the problems and challenges in South Africa. It was a
                      bleak time for me.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      Sometime during my apathy and depression, I applied to do
                      a course at the Life Choices Coding Academy. It honestly
                      was a scary time for me. I didn’t want to make another
                      mistake but I didn’t have many choices. Neither did I have
                      any motivation or direction. It was a pretty horrible time
                      for me as I didn’t want to be at home and be a burden on
                      my family.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      I was accepted to do the Coding Course and remember that
                      my depression took away my desire to engage with the other
                      learners as I had a fear of drawing people into my dark,
                      painful space and I didn’t want to hurt anyone who I might
                      get close to. Fortunately for me the curriculum included
                      professional and personal development which forced me out
                      of my comfort zone.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      Looking back I can see that when I joined the Coding
                      Academy I must have shown up as pretty arrogant knowing
                      that I had had better opportunities in high school than
                      most of the peers in my coding class. Getting to know my
                      peers and working on projects together was very humbling
                      for me. It got me to appreciate differences and diversity
                      and value opinions from others.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      Self-development has always been very important to me so
                      being integrated into the different cultures on the coding
                      course, helped to feel like I belonged rather than
                      following a growth journey of isolation.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      One of the life skills we had to participate in during the
                      coding courses was “Thinking Pairs.” I felt like I was
                      crossing my own boundaries during this time and I could
                      feel that I was breaking out of my shell by being heard
                      and having to express myself in a safe space. I got to
                      realise that I have given myself too little credit in the
                      past for what I’ve achieved. Being heard in thinking pairs
                      started to give me a sense of my value and worth. I’ve
                      become open to speaking to others, and to listening out
                      for other people’s stories. This has been valuable during
                      my internship as it has translated into being able to open
                      discussions and hear from my colleagues about their
                      challenges and ideas on projects.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      The personal development has you look inward. I got to
                      realise that as stubborn as I could see I had been in
                      aspects of my life I was able to reflect and learn that
                      external factors play a huge role in moulding who you are.
                      Being exposed to the various life skills at the Academy
                      got me to expand my worldview and my limited thinking.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      What was impactful to me during the coding course was that
                      we were expected to perform in many different scenarios
                      like working alone, working in a team, creating a product
                      in a team. A task we were given to achieve was to work in
                      a Design Thinking team to create a product which we had to
                      design, produce and showcase to our class. Our team
                      designed and produced a prototype virtual learning centre
                      which had lots of interactive opportunities like
                      animation, podcasts etc. Our objective was to make it
                      accessible to various learning styles. This process
                      enforced a collective thinking space where we could draw
                      on the life skills we had learnt so far. Having to present
                      our design with my team, to our peers, gave us a sense of
                      achievement, whilst we were also inspired by what the
                      other coders had created.

                      counselling which is where I identified a sense of
                      arrogance and where I learnt to be more accepting of
                      others rather than being judgemental. It helped me to not
                      be afraid of what I don’t know. I got to unlearn what I
                      thought was right and to open my world view.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      Having gone to a privileged high school, I was used to
                      talking in front of the class or the school. These skills
                      were expanded on during the presentation skills training
                      we had on the course. I learnt to focus on engaging with
                      the audience whilst being less aware of myself in the
                      process. It was less about me, and more about my audience.
                      These skills helped me focus on the interviewer during my
                      first internship interview, and encouraged me to have a
                      2-way interview where I could also ask questions. It gave
                      me the confidence to be myself during my interview which I
                      believe played a big role in me landing my internship.

                      Part of graduating from the Coding Academy is to be placed
                      in a 6 month internship. Within the first 3 months, the
                      feedback from my manager was how pleased she was in how I
                      had integrated into the team and that they could see the
                      value I was bringing to the business. They wanted me on
                      board and wanted to develop me as a programmer resulting
                      in me being offered a full time position as a junior web
                      developer.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      Something that was very valuable during my integration
                      into the company was applying the “learning how to learn”
                      skill we had done during the coding course. It taught us
                      the importance of taking breaks to ensure productivity. It
                      also taught us how to be open to ask for help instead of
                      isolating ourselves when we are feeling unsure of how to
                      do something, which can become counterproductive. I got to
                      accept that I am not a burden because I ask questions.
                      Conversely asking questions helped to develop and
                      integrate me into the team. Knowing that I was part of a
                      working team has helped me develop myself and has taught
                      me that it is valuable for the team to ask questions
                      ensuring there are more upskilled people on the team which
                      improves productivity.

                      I’ve recently been contemplating what my next career step
                      is and how to grow from what I’ve already learnt. I have a
                      yearning to travel internationally and earn dual
                      citizenship whilst also exposing myself to cutting edge
                      technology. A thought that I am keeping in mind is to one
                      day consult or own my own company but for the foreseeable
                      future I want to travel and gain as much exposure and
                      experience as I can.

                    <p class="alumni-modal-content">
                      On another level, I want to encourage South African youth
                      in poorer areas to be humble and be prepared to start
                      somewhere, even if it isn’t what they feel they deserve.
                      We all have a beginning point. It’s from this place that
                      we grow and educate ourselves. Being in a lesser position
                      is not dishonourable but not moving out of that position
                      because you feel the world owes you, or that you are
                      entitled, is the very attitude which will hold you back.
                      Take responsibility for your own story. Make it happen.
